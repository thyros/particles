.SH NAME
SDL_GetSurfaceProperties \- Get the properties associated with a surface\[char46]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "SDL_PropertiesID SDL_GetSurfaceProperties(SDL_Surface *surface);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The following properties are understood by SDL:


\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_PROP_SURFACE_COLOR_PRIMARIES_NUMBER
:
  an 
.BR SDL_ColorPrimaries
 value describing the surface
  colorspace

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_PROP_SURFACE_TRANSFER_CHARACTERISTICS_NUMBER
:
  an 
.BR SDL_TransferCharacteristics
 value
  describing the surface colorspace

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_PROP_SURFACE_MAXCLL_NUMBER
:
  MaxCLL (Maximum Content Light Level) indicates the maximum light level of
  any single pixel (in cd/m2 or nits) of the entire playback sequence\[char46]
  MaxCLL is usually measured off the final delivered content after
  mastering\[char46] If one uses the full light level of the HDR mastering display
  and adds a hard clip at its maximum value, MaxCLL would be equal to the
  peak luminance of the mastering monitor\[char46]

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_PROP_SURFACE_MAXFALL_NUMBER
:
  MaxFALL (Maximum Frame Average Light Level) indicates the maximum value
  of the frame average light level (in cd/m2 or nits) of the entire
  playback sequence\[char46] MaxFALL is calculated by averaging the decoded
  luminance values of all the pixels within a frame\[char46] MaxFALL is usually
  much lower than MaxCLL\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I surface
the 
.BR SDL_Surface
 structure to query
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns a valid property ID on success or 0 on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

.SH SEE ALSO
.BR SDL_GetProperty (3),
.BR SDL_SetProperty (3)
